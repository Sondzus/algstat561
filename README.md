#### Week 1 - invitation to algebraic statistics 

* [lecture 1 slides PDF](lecture1.pdf)
    * Additional notes on reasoning with data are written live. 
    * [notes version of the slides above](lecture1handout.html) <-- same content as slides
 * [lecture 2 content plan](lecture2.html)
 
> Homework 1 assigned. [due 1/18/2023->1/19/2023](hw1.pdf)
    
#### Week 2 - limiting distributions, why worry about which model fits the data, and intro to conditinoal independence

* [lecture 3 slides PDF](lecture3.pdf) 
* [additional handout on sampling distributions](lecture3-additionalhandout-563-SamplingDistributions.html)
* [in-class worksheet](ws1.pdf)  <-- *[Worksheet material from Kaie Kubjas, Aalto University, used with her permission.]*
* [post-lecture additional notes](lecture3-additionalhandout-marginalizing.html) 

#### Week 3 - the algebra of conditional independence

The plan is to cover the remainder of section 4.1 in the book. We will talk about the algebra / geometry behind conditional independence models.
**It is important to be familiar with the independence concepts so that you can better understand the lecture.**

* [lecture 4 slides PDF](lecture4.pdf) 
	* there is a typo on slide 8. can you spot it? (hint: which variable is non-binary...) 
* [in-class worksheet](ws2.pdf) 

And what happens with Gaussian models? 

* [lecture 5 slides PDF] will be posted by Wednesday. 

> Homework 2 will be assigned later this week. [due during week 5.]

## Useful Info 
    
* Interlude: create your first .Rmd file!   All of your HW will be submitted using markdown and html/pdf. Here are some templates, just so you know what to expect:
    * [514-hw-template.Rmd](https://github.com/Sondzus/StatsAnalytics/blob/master/514-hw-template.Rmd)
    * [514-hw-template.html](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Sondzus/StatsAnalytics/blob/master/514-hw-template.html)
    * [514-hw-template.pdf](https://github.com/Sondzus/StatsAnalytics/blob/master/514-hw-template.pdf)



## Types of files

* html - course handouts. **Note** To preview within the browser, **if** you are viewing raw github (e.g. master branch), then  prepend `https://htmlpreview.github.io/?` to the path in your browser, such as [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Sondzus/StatsAnalytics/blob/master/514-1.1-handout-DescriptiveStatistics.html) 
* PDF - slides for short illustrations used within a live lecture
* Rmd - raw R Markdown code. This has two purposes: 
	1) for students to see how the basic output files are generated, and 
	2) to enable collaborators to make updates to the materials in future semesters.
