## Course info
[Here](https://www.sonjapetrovicstats.com/teaching/561sp23) is the course homepage, which contains the course syllabus, topics, and more information. 



### Schedule 

#### Week 1 - invitation to algebraic statistics 

* [lecture 1 slides PDF](lecture1.pdf)
    * Additional notes on reasoning with data are written live. 
    * [notes version of the slides above](lecture1handout.html) $$\leftarrow$$ same content as slides
 * [lecture 2 content plan](lecture2.html)
    
    
 ## Useful Info 
    
* Interlude: create your first .Rmd file!   All of your HW will be submitted using markdown and html/pdf. Here are some templates, just so you know what to expect:
    * [514-hw-template.Rmd](514-hw-template.Rmd)
    * [514-hw-template.html](514-hw-template.html)
    * [514-hw-template.pdf](514-hw-template.pdf)



## Types of files

* html - course handouts. **Note** To preview within the browser, **if** you are viewing raw github (e.g. master branch), then  prepend `https://htmlpreview.github.io/?` to the path in your browser, such as [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Sondzus/StatsAnalytics/blob/master/514-1.1-handout-DescriptiveStatistics.html) 
* PDF - slides for short illustrations used within a live lecture
* Rmd - raw R Markdown code. This has two purposes: 
	1) for students to see how the basic HTML is generated, and 
	2) to enable collaborators to make updates to the materials in future semesters.
