Some of the notes for course materials on Applied Computational Statistics for Analytics, ITMD/ITMS/STAT 514 offered at Illinois Tech.

## Overview
The course materials were developed during Fall 2020 and Spring 2021. Future updates will be posted as the course evolves. 

## Course info
[Here](https://www.sonjapetrovicstats.com/teaching/514sp21) is the course homepage for the recent semester, Spring 2021, which contains the course syllabus, topics, and more information. 

## Types of files

* html - course handouts. **Note** To preview within the browser, **if** you are viewing raw github (e.g. master branch), then  prepend `https://htmlpreview.github.io/?` to the path in your browser, such as [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Sondzus/StatsAnalytics/blob/master/514-1.1-handout-DescriptiveStatistics.html) 
* PDF - slides for short illustrations used within a live lecture
* Rmd - raw R Markdown code. This has two purposes: 
	1) for students to see how the basic HTML is generated, and 
	2) to enable collaborators to make updates to the materials in future semesters.
