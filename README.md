## Course information

Math 561 is a graduate-level course on algebraic and geometric methods in statistics. Course homepage is [here](https://www.sonjapetrovicstats.com/teaching/561sp23), containing detailed info on the material, grading, etc. 

This page keeps track of course notes, material covered, homework schedule, and other relevant links. Unlike the static course homepage, this one is updated weekly. 

<!-- * In the next iterations of the course, the order of topics will likely remain the same, but the speed at which we cover material may change.--> 

* Most lectures use slides in the beginning, but I always also write on the board to supplement examples. 
* It is impossible to follow the course only by reading these slides; students are expected to attend the lectures as well. 
* All course communication, updates, announcements, logistics, and grading takes place on our Canvas course page.

## Week 1 - invitation to algebraic statistics 

* [lecture 1 slides PDF](lecture1.pdf)
    * Additional notes on reasoning with data are written live. 
    * [notes version of the slides above](lecture1handout.html) <-- same content as slides
* [lecture 2 content plan](lecture2.html)
 
> Homework 1 assigned. [due 1/18/2023->1/24/2023](hw1.pdf)

## Useful Info 
    
Sample files: how to create your first .Rmd file!   All of your HW can be submitted using markdown and html/pdf. Here are some templates I created for another course, just so you know what to expect:

* [514-hw-template.Rmd](https://github.com/Sondzus/StatsAnalytics/blob/master/514-hw-template.Rmd)
* [514-hw-template.html](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Sondzus/StatsAnalytics/blob/master/514-hw-template.html)
* [514-hw-template.pdf](https://github.com/Sondzus/StatsAnalytics/blob/master/514-hw-template.pdf)



#### Types of files

* html - course handouts.  <!--**Note** To preview within the browser, **if** you are viewing raw github (e.g. master branch), then  prepend `https://htmlpreview.github.io/?` to the path in your browser, such as [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Sondzus/StatsAnalytics/blob/master/514-1.1-handout-DescriptiveStatistics.html) --> 
* PDF - slides for short illustrations used within a live lecture
* Rmd - raw R Markdown code. This has two purposes: 
	1) for students to see how the basic output files are generated, and 
	2) to enable collaborators to make updates to the materials in future semesters.
